Did anyone survive? No, everyone aboard, including the crew, was killed instantly. What were the circumstances? Were they bad weather, a fire, or engine failure? Apparently, there were some low clouds in the area, but mostly it was just miscommunication between the pilots and the traffic controllers. Weren't they both speaking in English, the official international aviation language? Yes they were, but the transmit ion from poor quality radios was slightly distorted and the accents of the Spanish speaking controllers was so strong that the pilots that the pilots misunderstood a vital instruction.

The instruction actually meant 22,000 feet, but they thought they heard descend 2,000 feet. That's a huge difference, and it should have been confirmed, but it was not. Unfortunately, the terrain of the mountains in Norweija ascends to 2,000 feet. So the pilots did descend to the wrong altitude then, because they were following the air controllers instructions.

We have been hearing a couple of things about this news that Ford Motor Company is slashing up to 30,000 jobs, shutting down 14 plants nationwide. Is it a big deal if we are no longer manufacturing these cars, Malcolm? I think it's a huge deal. I mean the companies are massive employers both directly and indirectly. If you look at Ford after their restructuring, they've actually got 87,000 employees which is twice as many as Microsoft have worldwide. Moreover, if you look at those jobs, they are very high-paying jobs. These are people who can afford to buy their own products. Er, it seems to indicate a big hit for our economy if these jobs go bye-bye. Yeah, it's a really sad day for America. But it is not as if cars are stopped being made, right? Correct. Still a large number of cars are being made by American manufacturers. More than half of the American cars sold in America are American. So what has happened over time is that as the market share has fallen, foreign car companies have come in, taken over plants and set up new plants, and they have taken over that capacity. So, it is not like there are fewer cars being produced in America than there were 30 years ago. Let me ask you about the Chinese coming in. What would it mean to American jobs, if and when that happens? The Chinese cars we have seen so far aren't that great and they don't have the branding necessary to make a huge impact in the world stage.

We have been hearing a couple of things about this news that Ford Motor Company is slashing up to 30,000 jobs, shutting down 14 plants nationwide. Is it a big deal if we are no longer manufacturing these cars, Malcolm? I think it's a huge deal. I mean the companies are massive employers both directly and indirectly. If you look at Ford after their restructuring, they've actually got 87,000 employees which is twice as many as Microsoft have worldwide. Moreover, if you look at those jobs, they are very high-paying jobs. These are people who can afford to buy their own products. Er, it seems to indicate a big hit for our economy if these jobs go bye-bye. Yeah, it's a really sad day for America. But it is not as if cars are stopped being made, right? Correct. Still a large number of cars are being made by American manufacturers. More than half of the American cars sold in America are American. So what has happened over time is that as the market share has fallen, foreign car companies have come in, taken over plants and set up new plants, and they have taken over that capacity. So, it is not like there are fewer cars being produced in America than there were 30 years ago. Let me ask you about the Chinese coming in. What would it mean to American jobs, if and when that happens? The Chinese cars we have seen so far aren't that great and they don't have the branding necessary to make a huge impact in the world stage.

We have been hearing a couple of things about this news that Ford Motor Company is slashing up to 30,000 jobs, shutting down 14 plants nationwide. Is it a big deal if we are no longer manufacturing these cars, Malcolm? I think it's a huge deal. I mean the companies are massive employers both directly and indirectly. If you look at Ford after their restructuring, they've actually got 87,000 employees which is twice as many as Microsoft have worldwide. Moreover, if you look at those jobs, they are very high-paying jobs. These are people who can afford to buy their own products. Er, it seems to indicate a big hit for our economy if these jobs go bye-bye. Yeah, it's a really sad day for America. But it is not as if cars are stopped being made, right? Correct. Still a large number of cars are being made by American manufacturers. More than half of the American cars sold in America are American. So what has happened over time is that as the market share has fallen, foreign car companies have come in, taken over plants and set up new plants, and they have taken over that capacity. So, it is not like there are fewer cars being produced in America than there were 30 years ago. Let me ask you about the Chinese coming in. What would it mean to American jobs, if and when that happens?

3383,dream-0441-triplet-6,0,What does 'tragic accident' cause?,"Did you hear about the air crash that occurred in South America recently? It was quite a tragic accident! No, I didn't see anything in the news about it. What happened? A foreign airliner was attempting to land at night in a mountainous area in Argentina and flew into a hill! That sounds really terrible! Did anyone survive? No, everyone aboard, including the crew, was killed instantly. What were the circumstances? Were they bad weather, a fire, or engine failure? Apparently, there were some low clouds in the area, but mostly it was just miscommunication between the pilots and the traffic controllers. Weren't they both speaking in English, the official international aviation language? Yes they were, but the transmit ion from poor quality radios was slightly distorted and the accents of the Spanish speaking controllers was so strong that the pilots that the pilots misunderstood a vital instruction. How could a misunderstanding like that cause such a serious accident? The pilots were told to descend to 2-2,000 feet. The instruction actually meant 22,000 feet, but they thought they heard descend 2,000 feet. That's a huge difference, and it should have been confirmed, but it was not. Unfortunately, the terrain of the mountains in Norweija ascends to 2,000 feet. So the pilots did descend to the wrong altitude then, because they were following the air controllers instructions. Sadly enough, yes they did. It was a really bad mistake. Many people died as a result of the simply understanding. Wow, that's a powerful lesson on how important it can be to accurately communicate to each other.

We have been hearing a couple of things about this news that Ford Motor Company is slashing up to 30,000 jobs, shutting down 14 plants nationwide. Is it a big deal if we are no longer manufacturing these cars, Malcolm? I think it's a huge deal. I mean the companies are massive employers both directly and indirectly. If you look at Ford after their restructuring, they've actually got 87,000 employees which is twice as many as Microsoft have worldwide. Moreover, if you look at those jobs, they are very high-paying jobs. These are people who can afford to buy their own products. Er, it seems to indicate a big hit for our economy if these jobs go bye-bye. Yeah, it's a really sad day for America. But it is not as if cars are stopped being made, right? Correct. Still a large number of cars are being made by American manufacturers. More than half of the American cars sold in America are American. So what has happened over time is that as the market share has fallen, foreign car companies have come in, taken over plants and set up new plants, and they have taken over that capacity. So, it is not like there are fewer cars being produced in America than there were 30 years ago. Let me ask you about the Chinese coming in. What would it mean to American jobs, if and when that happens? The Chinese cars we have seen so far aren't that great and they don't have the branding necessary to make a huge impact in the world stage.

Well, my mum wants me to keep all the cans, so that we can sell them after a while. Aha, you are going to make a millionaire of yourself sooner or later with all those cans. You bet I will.

3787,dream-0879-triplet-5,0,What does 'shutting down 14 plants' cause?,"With us now, is Malcolm Bricklin, CEO of Visionary Vehicles. Hello, everyone. We have been hearing a couple of things about this news that Ford Motor Company is slashing up to 30,000 jobs, shutting down 14 plants nationwide. Is it a big deal if we are no longer manufacturing these cars, Malcolm? I think it's a huge deal. I mean the companies are massive employers both directly and indirectly. If you look at Ford after their restructuring, they've actually got 87,000 employees which is twice as many as Microsoft have worldwide. Moreover, if you look at those jobs, they are very high-paying jobs. These are people who can afford to buy their own products. Er, it seems to indicate a big hit for our economy if these jobs go bye-bye. Yeah, it's a really sad day for America. But it is not as if cars are stopped being made, right? Correct. Still a large number of cars are being made by American manufacturers. More than half of the American cars sold in America are American. So what has happened over time is that as the market share has fallen, foreign car companies have come in, taken over plants and set up new plants, and they have taken over that capacity. So, it is not like there are fewer cars being produced in America than there were 30 years ago. Let me ask you about the Chinese coming in. What would it mean to American jobs, if and when that happens? The Chinese cars we have seen so far aren't that great and they don't have the branding necessary to make a huge impact in the world stage.

No, I didn't see anything in the news about it. What happened? A foreign airliner was attempting to land at night in a mountainous area in Argentina and flew into a hill! That sounds really terrible! Did anyone survive? No, everyone aboard, including the crew, was killed instantly. What were the circumstances? Were they bad weather, a fire, or engine failure? Apparently, there were some low clouds in the area, but mostly it was just miscommunication between the pilots and the traffic controllers. Weren't they both speaking in English, the official international aviation language? Yes they were, but the transmit ion from poor quality radios was slightly distorted and the accents of the Spanish speaking controllers was so strong that the pilots that the pilots misunderstood a vital instruction. How could a misunderstanding like that cause such a serious accident? The pilots were told to descend to 2-2,000 feet. The instruction actually meant 22,000 feet, but they thought they heard descend 2,000 feet. That's a huge difference, and it should have been confirmed, but it was not. Unfortunately, the terrain of the mountains in Norweija ascends to 2,000 feet. So the pilots did descend to the wrong altitude then, because they were following the air controllers instructions.

That they glue themselves to rocks in the ocean, shortly after birth. They also stay in the same place forever. Right, have you ever tried removing one of those things? It would be easier to chip the rock away than to get the barnacles off. Exactly, and that's why scientists are trying to figure out what the barnacles glue is made of.

Precisely, and because it's natural protein, it probably wouldn't be harmful to people like so many synthetic glues in use today.

3788,dream-0879-triplet-6,0,What does 'foreign car companies have come in' cause?,"With us now, is Malcolm Bricklin, CEO of Visionary Vehicles. Hello, everyone. We have been hearing a couple of things about this news that Ford Motor Company is slashing up to 30,000 jobs, shutting down 14 plants nationwide. Is it a big deal if we are no longer manufacturing these cars, Malcolm? I think it's a huge deal. I mean the companies are massive employers both directly and indirectly. If you look at Ford after their restructuring, they've actually got 87,000 employees which is twice as many as Microsoft have worldwide. Moreover, if you look at those jobs, they are very high-paying jobs. These are people who can afford to buy their own products. Er, it seems to indicate a big hit for our economy if these jobs go bye-bye. Yeah, it's a really sad day for America. But it is not as if cars are stopped being made, right? Correct. Still a large number of cars are being made by American manufacturers. More than half of the American cars sold in America are American. So what has happened over time is that as the market share has fallen, foreign car companies have come in, taken over plants and set up new plants, and they have taken over that capacity. So, it is not like there are fewer cars being produced in America than there were 30 years ago. Let me ask you about the Chinese coming in. What would it mean to American jobs, if and when that happens? The Chinese cars we have seen so far aren't that great and they don't have the branding necessary to make a huge impact in the world stage.

We have been hearing a couple of things about this news that Ford Motor Company is slashing up to 30,000 jobs, shutting down 14 plants nationwide. Is it a big deal if we are no longer manufacturing these cars, Malcolm? I think it's a huge deal. I mean the companies are massive employers both directly and indirectly. If you look at Ford after their restructuring, they've actually got 87,000 employees which is twice as many as Microsoft have worldwide. Moreover, if you look at those jobs, they are very high-paying jobs. These are people who can afford to buy their own products. Er, it seems to indicate a big hit for our economy if these jobs go bye-bye. Yeah, it's a really sad day for America. But it is not as if cars are stopped being made, right? Correct. Still a large number of cars are being made by American manufacturers. More than half of the American cars sold in America are American. So what has happened over time is that as the market share has fallen, foreign car companies have come in, taken over plants and set up new plants, and they have taken over that capacity. So, it is not like there are fewer cars being produced in America than there were 30 years ago. Let me ask you about the Chinese coming in. What would it mean to American jobs, if and when that happens?

No, I didn't see anything in the news about it. What happened? A foreign airliner was attempting to land at night in a mountainous area in Argentina and flew into a hill! That sounds really terrible! Did anyone survive? No, everyone aboard, including the crew, was killed instantly. What were the circumstances? Were they bad weather, a fire, or engine failure? Apparently, there were some low clouds in the area, but mostly it was just miscommunication between the pilots and the traffic controllers. Weren't they both speaking in English, the official international aviation language? Yes they were, but the transmit ion from poor quality radios was slightly distorted and the accents of the Spanish speaking controllers was so strong that the pilots that the pilots misunderstood a vital instruction. How could a misunderstanding like that cause such a serious accident? The pilots were told to descend to 2-2,000 feet. The instruction actually meant 22,000 feet, but they thought they heard descend 2,000 feet. That's a huge difference, and it should have been confirmed, but it was not. Unfortunately, the terrain of the mountains in Norweija ascends to 2,000 feet. So the pilots did descend to the wrong altitude then, because they were following the air controllers instructions. Sadly enough, yes they did. It was a really bad mistake. Many people died as a result of the simply understanding. Wow, that's a powerful lesson on how important it can be to accurately communicate to each other.

We have been hearing a couple of things about this news that Ford Motor Company is slashing up to 30,000 jobs, shutting down 14 plants nationwide. Is it a big deal if we are no longer manufacturing these cars, Malcolm? I think it's a huge deal. I mean the companies are massive employers both directly and indirectly. If you look at Ford after their restructuring, they've actually got 87,000 employees which is twice as many as Microsoft have worldwide. Moreover, if you look at those jobs, they are very high-paying jobs. These are people who can afford to buy their own products. Er, it seems to indicate a big hit for our economy if these jobs go bye-bye. Yeah, it's a really sad day for America. But it is not as if cars are stopped being made, right? Correct. Still a large number of cars are being made by American manufacturers. More than half of the American cars sold in America are American. So what has happened over time is that as the market share has fallen, foreign car companies have come in, taken over plants and set up new plants, and they have taken over that capacity. So, it is not like there are fewer cars being produced in America than there were 30 years ago. Let me ask you about the Chinese coming in. What would it mean to American jobs, if and when that happens? The Chinese cars we have seen so far aren't that great and they don't have the branding necessary to make a huge impact in the world stage.

No, I didn't see anything in the news about it. What happened? A foreign airliner was attempting to land at night in a mountainous area in Argentina and flew into a hill! That sounds really terrible! Did anyone survive? No, everyone aboard, including the crew, was killed instantly. What were the circumstances? Were they bad weather, a fire, or engine failure? Apparently, there were some low clouds in the area, but mostly it was just miscommunication between the pilots and the traffic controllers. Weren't they both speaking in English, the official international aviation language? Yes they were, but the transmit ion from poor quality radios was slightly distorted and the accents of the Spanish speaking controllers was so strong that the pilots that the pilots misunderstood a vital instruction. How could a misunderstanding like that cause such a serious accident? The pilots were told to descend to 2-2,000 feet. The instruction actually meant 22,000 feet, but they thought they heard descend 2,000 feet. That's a huge difference, and it should have been confirmed, but it was not. Unfortunately, the terrain of the mountains in Norweija ascends to 2,000 feet. So the pilots did descend to the wrong altitude then, because they were following the air controllers instructions. Sadly enough, yes they did. It was a really bad mistake. Many people died as a result of the simply understanding.

You know this isn't the first time that people are saying Brazil will be a great economic power. The same thing was said over a hundred year ago. But it didn't happen. Yes, but you must admit the world's a very different place now. Of course. In fact I believe there's maybe some truth in the prediction this time around.

A lot of work needs to be done to help people in those areas improve their lives. What needs to be done? Education, for example.

Brazil needs to learn from these countries. So you are hopeful for the future. As I said earlier, I'm hopeful. This isn't an easy job.

3792,dream-0879-triplet-10,0,What prerequisite does 'make a huge impact' have?,"With us now, is Malcolm Bricklin, CEO of Visionary Vehicles. Hello, everyone. We have been hearing a couple of things about this news that Ford Motor Company is slashing up to 30,000 jobs, shutting down 14 plants nationwide. Is it a big deal if we are no longer manufacturing these cars, Malcolm? I think it's a huge deal. I mean the companies are massive employers both directly and indirectly. If you look at Ford after their restructuring, they've actually got 87,000 employees which is twice as many as Microsoft have worldwide. Moreover, if you look at those jobs, they are very high-paying jobs. These are people who can afford to buy their own products. Er, it seems to indicate a big hit for our economy if these jobs go bye-bye. Yeah, it's a really sad day for America. But it is not as if cars are stopped being made, right? Correct. Still a large number of cars are being made by American manufacturers. More than half of the American cars sold in America are American. So what has happened over time is that as the market share has fallen, foreign car companies have come in, taken over plants and set up new plants, and they have taken over that capacity. So, it is not like there are fewer cars being produced in America than there were 30 years ago. Let me ask you about the Chinese coming in.

3791,dream-0879-triplet-9,0,What property does 'Chinese cars' have?,"With us now, is Malcolm Bricklin, CEO of Visionary Vehicles. Hello, everyone. We have been hearing a couple of things about this news that Ford Motor Company is slashing up to 30,000 jobs, shutting down 14 plants nationwide. Is it a big deal if we are no longer manufacturing these cars, Malcolm? I think it's a huge deal. I mean the companies are massive employers both directly and indirectly. If you look at Ford after their restructuring, they've actually got 87,000 employees which is twice as many as Microsoft have worldwide. Moreover, if you look at those jobs, they are very high-paying jobs. These are people who can afford to buy their own products. Er, it seems to indicate a big hit for our economy if these jobs go bye-bye. Yeah, it's a really sad day for America. But it is not as if cars are stopped being made, right? Correct. Still a large number of cars are being made by American manufacturers. More than half of the American cars sold in America are American. So what has happened over time is that as the market share has fallen, foreign car companies have come in, taken over plants and set up new plants, and they have taken over that capacity. So, it is not like there are fewer cars being produced in America than there were 30 years ago. Let me ask you about the Chinese coming in. What would it mean to American jobs, if and when that happens? The Chinese cars we have seen so far aren't that great and they don't have the branding necessary to make a huge impact in the world stage.
